## Terminology

* Use "column impact" view to identify potential target leakage

* "SHAP Baselines for Explainability" ??


The preview model in Amazon SageMaker Canvas trains a relatively simple model with fixed hyperparameters. 

SageMaker Canvas does some level of pre-processing and data balancing when building a Standard Model. Some of the algorithms used by SageMaker Canvas already handle imbalanced data through some of their hyper-parameters.
