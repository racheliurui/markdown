# 081.mp4 082.mp4 - ELB Overview


* An SSL Cert must being installed on ELB and then we can use ELB to do "SSL Termination"
   * The user should need have access to use the AWS certificate service
   * SSL protocols supported: TLS1.0 1.1 1.3 and SSLv3
   * "Server Order Preference", used to negotiate the cipher. Server will use it's own list and find the top one that client supports.
      * So server can define the most preferred Cipher at the top of server's list.
* ELB health check
   * check the status of instances behind it
   * Can be used with AutoScaling service
* ELB security groups
   * inbound 443 , outbound depends on backend server port
* ELB setting
   * Idle Connection Timeout
   * Connection Draining
   * Cross Zone load balancing: 默认情况下，每个ELB实例只把请求分发到自己AZ下的instance；如果enable “cross zone”，那么请求可以被Azone的ELB实例分发到Bzone的后台server上。
* Proxy Protocol Support
   * 保证了后台可以正确的返回请求； 需要后台支持Proxy protocol Support
   * NGinx 支持， apache不支持
* ELB sticky sessions
   * enable ELB to route a certain user always to same backend instance; if backend instance become unhealthy, then stickness can be moved to another instance
   * Application controlled: application can decide whether to include the cookie generated from ELB back to client or not
* ELB monitoring
   * integrate with Cloudwatch , sending out health check every __60s__
   * Access Logs : saved to S3n (pulished at default __60min__ interval)
   * CloudTrail : Log API calls for ELB
* ELB troubleshooting
