# Rout53 Overview

It's the entry point of distributed infra at backend.

![DNS in nutshell](https://github.com/racheliurui/markdown/blob/master/Trending/AWS/images/024_Route53_DNS.png?raw=true)

History,
1) static DNS
2) dynamic DNS
   * same domain name, based on user source or other properites, assign different resolving result
3) Policy based

## Terminology

__Traffic Policy__ : Rules routing to points
__Traffic Policy Record__ : domain name with an applied traffic policy version.

__Hosted Zones__:
__DNS Records__:  route request to the correct endpoint address


## Steps to use Route53

1) Register your domain name with Route53 or other registra (needs some process to update)
  * WHOIS query privacy protect
  * Can transfer between aws account

2) Create Hosted Zone
  * Option1: Create Public Hosted Zone
    * For domain registered with AWS, Hosted Zone is created automatically.
    * It means you bind your domain name with AWS name servers.
  * Option2: Create Private Hosted Zone
    * Benefit: 1) any name 2) hide your server ip address by refer the domain name

3) DNS Records
   * Record Name
     * you can have root domain as one record (yoursite.com)
     * you can create subdomain as one record (www.yoursite.com)
     * you can create wildcard domain as record ( __*.yourwebsite__ )
   * Record Type :
     * NS : name resolve
     * IP
     * CName (pointing to other record name)
     * Alias -- used to pointing to other aws services; ELB, Elastic Beanstalk; CloudFront (alternative domain name must match route53 hosted domain name); S3 (bucketname must match route53 hosted domain name)
     * MX Record: email
     * TXT record: email validation, web analytics; certificates

4) Delegate to Route53
   * For Route53 registered domain, automatically created record with
     * Record name = your domain Name
     * Record Type: NS
     * Value: __delegation set__ list of AWS Route53 name servers specified for you (every customer has different set)
   * For name with other registra, change from other registra's console to update name servers to AWS's __delegation Set__

5) Wait -- for domain registered with other registra , wait 48 hours.

## Useful tools to debug

```shell
# check if the domain can be correctly resolved
$ dig google.com

# Check if the name server is correctly configured
$ dig NS google.com

# trace the sequence of the name resolve result; from root to com to google.com
$ dig NS google.com +trace

```

# Private DNS


Option1,
* Set up unbound inside VPS as the forwarder
* request from inside on-premise will go through forwarder to +2 resolver and routing to Route53 and then comming back

Option2,
* Set up AWS Active Directory as the forwarder

# Advanced features


## Check health

* check one endpoint ; check Cloudwatch alarms ; check other health checks;
* by checking health to implement failover : Active/Active ; Active/Standby
* New feature(2015): calculated health check, can combine multiple health check result (combine and, or calculation results).
  * also support latency

## Dynamic Route

* Routing internet trafic to your aws resources (Simple; Latency based; GEO based; Weighted Round Robin; Failover)

## Traffic Flow

* Graphic Tool to help define the Route53 policy


# Bills

* DNS service
   * Pays for hosted zones you configure and number of queries Route 53 answer

* Route53 service limites (50 domain per account)



# Use Cases

Warner Bros: they have a lot of domains (>25000), some zone has more than 10,000 records
  * Set up more than 150 account to isolate application & Bill and Security
  * Move from on-promise solution (Bind9). Suffer from HA, Failover,lack API (automation), lack Self Serice feature
  * Migrate key points
    * Upper some of Rout53 limite (hosted zone per account, etc)
    * Plan & Tools ; Tool to batch migrate, tool to validate
    * Lower the TTL during migration
    * Opensourced Tool : __cli53__
    * Upfront investment in automation result in a smooth, error free migration.
  * Review: __Catchpoint__ DNS monitoring result, huge improvement

# Migrate existing DNS to Route53

Correct Sequence to garantee __availability__
1) import DNS to Route53
   * manually or use cli53
2) Delegate to Route53
   * after import each zone will have unique nameserver, use command line (registar specifed) to apply delegate to Route53 name server
   * dig +trace to verify the delegation is successful
3) Transfer Domain to AWS Route53
   * registar specific command to transfer the domain

# Hybrid environment

* Option 1, make use of __unbound__ service as DNS forwarder (linux yum install)
* Option 2, make use of __AWS Active Directory__ service as forwarder
