# Differenciation

https://www.sumologic.com/blog/amazon-web-services/aws-config-vs-cloudtrail/
Both tools are helpful when implementing a self-serve IT policy. Config works well with CloudFormation to enable IT to create approved templates for every type of AWS resource. These templates, when shared with developers, let them provision the resources they require without needing ITâ€™s approval every time. It speeds up development, and importantly, enforces a consistent level of quality across the organization. If an employee changes the template while creating the resource, Config catches the change and notifies IT of the violation. If IT wants to dig deeper, they can use CloudTrail to help discover who made the change, from where, and when.
